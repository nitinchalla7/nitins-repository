Once upon a time, a woman named Deb taught a large group of students. She majored in dance in college and is now teaching a dance class to about 200 students. She believes that dancing is more important than computer science because dancing is cooler. She wants to dance for the rest of her life and hope her students feel the same way. 
Deb loved all styles of dance, jazz, musical theatre, ballroom, even hip hop. But her favorite of all time, was tap dancing. Deb would tap, all day. On the sidewalks, in the library, she would even break out into dance during her CS400 lecture.

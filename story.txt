Once upon a time, a woman named Deb taught a large group of students. She majored in dance in college and is now teaching a dance class to about 200 students. She believes that dancing is more important than computer science because dancing is cooler. She wants to dance for the rest of her life and hope her students feel the same way. 
Deb loved all styles of dance, jazz, musical theatre, ballroom, even hip hop. But her favorite of all time, was tap dancing. Deb would tap, all day. On the sidewalks, in the library, she would even break out into dance during her CS400 lecture.
The tap-tap-tap of her toe could rival that of a rooftop during a rainstorm. It was beautifully melodic and flowed with an elegance second to only the waves of the Pasific. Inevitably, Deb had grown to wonder: what is the purpose of dancing alone when there are over 7 billion other dancers to find? So she sought a dance partner.
Where did she go to find this dance partner of hers? The mall, of course! She would tap dance in the plaza until someone would join her. That person, she thought, would be the one to take her dancing to the next level.

Then she saw him. The light shone down strongly on his face. He turned and she saw that it was Michael Jackson. His death was a hoax. They danced the night away and even danced into her next CS400 lecture where she assigned the students with a program that drew Michael and Deb. They danced happily ever after. The End.
